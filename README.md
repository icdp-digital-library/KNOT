# Supporting a New Digital Ecosystem of Culture...
KNOT is a three-year pilot project from the University of Bologna and the Central Institute for the Digitization of Cultural Heritage (ICDP) - Digital Library of the Italian Ministry of Culture to showcase the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities.

The project is part of an agreement between the University of Bologna and the Ministry to establish a research infrastructure to support the digital ecosystem of culture that is a central part of the ICDPâ€™s mission. To this end the University of Bologna is carrying out parallel and connected research initiatives in three departments (Department of Cultural Heritage - DBC, Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies - FICLIT, and Department of Computer Science and Engineering - DISI) with the goal of investigating ways to integrate the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities within the national infrastructure.
