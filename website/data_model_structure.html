      <h1 class="text-body-emphasis">The KNOT Data Model - Overview</h1>
      <p>KNOT-DM is focused on the intersection of three domains that reflect specific aspects of the project’s central theme:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Academia — representing the universities and their agents (academics, researchers, departments, laboratories, students) as well as the activity of research and the digital objects created by it.</li>
        <li>Public data — representing how the digital products of academic research are often publicly available in order to facilitate and foster further research and use.  </li>
        <li>(Digital) Cultural heritage — representing both the subjects of academic research (people, works, physical objects) and its outputs (datasets, software, digital-born or digitized objects) as examples of (digital) cultural heritage.</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>This intersection provides the structural outline of the KNOT-DM, which is organized in three segments that reflect the specificities of each domain and make use of concepts from an internationally recognized standard to describe entities, activities, agents, themes, relationships, and spatio-temporal information. The segments and their relative standards are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public Data Segment — modeled with the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), a W3C RDF vocabulary “designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs” published online [<a href="#bib-1">1</a>]. It is used to represent academic research outputs as public data in the form of conceptual entities such as datasets or data services. KNOT-DM combines ontological entities and their usage from the DCAT W3C specification as well as the European and Italian Application Profiles (<a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/tree/2.1.0-draft/releases" target="_blank">DCAT AP</a> and <a href="https://www.dati.gov.it/content/dcat-ap-it-v10-profilo-italiano-dcat-ap-0" target="_blank">DCAT AP IT</a>).</li>
        <li>Academic Provenance Segment — modeled with the PROV Ontology (PROV-O), a W3C OWL2 Web Ontology Language designed to “represent provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts” [<a href="#bib-2">2</a>]. It is used to represent the specificities of academic research activity and production and was chosen because it is already integrated into DCAT.</li>
        <li>Cultural Heritage Information Segment — modeled with the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM), a “living standard” that offers “a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage” [<a href="#bib-3">3</a>]. It is used to represent specific activities within a research project as well as outputs with a focus on the cultural heritage information they relate to. KNOT-DM primarily makes use of the CRMdig and LRMoo extensions of CIDOC CRM. The former models “the steps and methods of production ("provenance") of digitization products and synthetic digital representations” [<a href="#bib-4">4</a>] and as such offers various concepts that align with standard academic research project practices, while the latter is “intended to capture and represent the underlying semantics of bibliographic information and to facilitate the integration, mediation, and interchange of bibliographic and museum information” [<a href="#bib-5">5</a>] and is primarily used to enable relations with the WEMI (Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item) concept of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records model. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Figures 1 and 2 summarise the core of the KNOT-DM by highlighting key classes (yellow boxes) and properties (arrows) from each standard and their interconnection as well as relationship to the entities (pink dots) central to the project. Further details on the full extent of each segment is provided in the next section.</p>

      <p>The use of internationally recognised and complimentary standards stems from an early design decision that KNOT-DM should be focused on reusability rather than the creation of new ontological components in order to allow flexibility and ensure its eventual compatibility with the Digital Library infrastructure. Furthermore, this flexibility should also enable the KNOT project to integrate existing information and data about academic research in order to minimise duplication and foster interconnectivity. One early area of interest in this regard is in exploring how KNOT can integrate with <a href="https://www.cineca.it/sistemi-informativi-universita/ricerca/iris-la-gestione-della-ricerca" target="_blank">the IRIS research management system</a> offered to Italian universities by CINECA.</p>

      <p>All of the KNOT-DM terms and concepts are collected and expressed in RDF via <a href="website/ontology/index-en.html" target="_blank">the KNOT Ontology (KNOT-O)</a> while some of its thematic and indexing requirements are expressed in RDF via the KNOT Taxonomy and KNOT Technology Thesaurus, two controlled vocabularies based on the SKOS data model. The use of existing standards based on, or adapted to, RDF enables the KNOT project to publish its metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD) to ensure machine readability and maximise its interoperability with other existing data available online. This is exemplified by the use of DCAT which is the standard used by the Italian Department for Digital Transformation and is one of the recommended ontologies from the national <a href="https://github.com/icdp-digital-library/daf-ontologie-vocabolari-controllati" target="_blank">OntoPia</a> network of ontologies and controlled vocabularies promoted by the Ministry of Culture and ICDP. </p>

      <p><a href="https://essepuntato.it/samod/" target="_blank">The SAMOD methodology</a> was used as a key reference point in the design of the KNOT-DM to create an iterative workflow: once the central theme was chosen, the domain was designed by researching and evaluating existing standards against a first set of requirements drawn in part from the information acquired during the census of existing academic research projects; each standard was then assembled into a segment and evaluated against a first set of competency questions (who, what, where, when, how) by modeling a small subset of data from the census (12 entries); following this further refinements were made to which elements of the standards the model should use and how they should connect and be used; insights from this step also led to the creation of the controlled vocabularies; lastly the first version of the ontology and documentation was created drawing from the insights acquired in each previous step.</p>

      <p>Following publication of the first version of the data model in the summer of 2023, further evaluation will continue using the SAMOD methodology, with particular attention to the different modules and their ability to answer the competency questions.</p>

      <p>All elements of the KNOT-DM, including KNOT-O and the KNOT Taxonomy and KNOT Technological Thesaurus controlled vocabularies, are published in English and Italian and available from <a href="https://github.com/icdp-digital-library/KNOT" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under a Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 license.</p>

        <p>Figures 3 to 5 give a complete overview of the public data segment of the KNOT-DM, which is the largest in terms of classes and properties available for use. Each figure details the properties and classes connected to one of four central DCAT concepts: Catalog, Dataset, Data Service, and Distribution. </p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded mx-auto" src="assets/imgs/dcat_mapping_catalog.jpg">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">FIG 3. DCAT Catalog with all connectable properties and classes.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Figure 3 details the first part of the segment, centered on the Catalog class. This class is defined within KNOT-DM as a “catalogue or repository that hosts the datasets or data services being described” [<a href="#bib-6">6</a>] based on the DCAT Application Profile. It also takes into consideration the W3C DCAT definition, “a curated collection of metadata about resources (e.g., datasets and data services in the context of a data catalog),” [<a href="#bib-1">1</a>] and a usage note that web-based data catalogs represent a single instance of this class. </p>
        <p>These definitions are the starting point for the conceptualization of the Catalog class as a representation of academic research projects as containers, rather than activities, for outputs (which are modeled using the DCAT dataset and data service classes, see below). The most common and practical example of this conceptualization is a website where the research project activity and outputs are documented and made available to the public, whether via direct download or through interaction with specific user interfaces. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, the W3C DCAT specification explicitly makes Catalog a sub-class of Dataset which adds another layer to this conceptualization by allowing KNOT-DM to treat the academic research project as container as another form of output from the research project as activity.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded mx-auto" src="assets/imgs/dcat_mapping_dataset.jpg">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">FIG 4. DCAT Dataset with all connectable properties and classes.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Figure 4 details the second part of the segment, centered on the Dataset class. It is defined within KNOT-DM as “a collection of data published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations” based on the W3C specification and an additional note that states “data comes in many forms including numbers, words, pixels, imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which might be collected into a dataset.” [<a href="#bib-1">1</a>] </p>
        <p>From this, KNOT-DM conceptualizes the Dataset class as the representation of the digital outputs of academic research projects, whatever their form. This last point is key because while the DCAT standard is primarily used in the EU and Italy to classify datasets from public entities, such as government agencies, the KNOT-DM uses it to cover all types of digital outputs from academic research: a pdf of a paper, a piece of software, a textual corpus, a relational database, a collection of annotated images, an interactive map, or a visualization service. </p>
        <p>As mentioned above, within KNOT-DM Dataset is the super-class of Catalog, meaning that the activity which created the dataset (the research project) also exists as an instance of a dataset that contains other datasets representing all the outputs of the activity, alongside their possible distributions and interactive services.</p>
        <p>The Dataset class also offers a direct connection to the Academic Provenance segment of the KNOT-DM via the prov:wasGeneratedBy property, which DCAT includes in order to allow users to further “describe the activity that generated a dataset.” [<a href="#bib-1">1</a>] DCAT specification notes that in order to use this property the context resource should also be classified as a prov:Entity, which is the approach KNOT-DM takes. This means that within KNOT-DM, instances of a DCAT Dataset should also be instances of a PROV Entity. This approach to multiple classifications of individuals is detailed in the section about Conceptually Similar Classes.</p>
        <figure class="figure">

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">FIG 5. DCAT Data Service and Distribution with all connectable properties and classes.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Figure 5 details the third and final part of the public data segment, centered on the Distribution and Data Service classes. These two are grouped together as they are closely connected by virtue of giving access to the data included in the catalogue, however they have some key differences. </p>
        <p>A Distribution is defined within KNOT-DM as an “accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file” [<a href="#bib-1">1</a>], based on the W3C specification. However, the term “accessible form” could be interpreted as covering non-downloadable forms and so KNOT-DM makes the limitation of Distribution to downloadable forms explicit (this is also implied in the EU Application Profile usage notes and definitions). A Data Service is defined within KNOT-DM as “a collection of operations that provides access to one or more datasets or data processing functions,” based on the DCAT AP specification [<a href="#bib-6">6</a>]. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, KNOT-DM makes explicit reference to the usage note [<a href="#bib-7">7</a>] included in DCAT AP 2.1.1 regarding distinctions between these two classes which adds the following conceptual dimensions to both: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A distribution cannot exist without its dataset while both a dataset and data service are conceptual entities of their own.</li>
          <li>A distribution is not required to be the result of the data service operations.</li>
          <li>Anything not intended to provide a downloadable form of a dataset is a data service.</li>
          <li>A data service offers smarter, more interactive ways to the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As such within KNOT-DM Distribution is conceptualized as the downloadable form of a dataset only, and it is possible for a dataset to exist without it such as for example when a relational database can be accessed via a search interface but not directly for download. A data service is conceptualized to represent all other web services that give a user access to the data contained within a dataset via any number of processing functions. To follow the previous example, the search interface for the relational database would constitute a data service in this case. Within the domain of the KNOT project, data services can represent anything from API endpoints to website search interfaces and analytics services. In many cases it is possible that the data service is part of the same website that is conceptualized as a Catalog and which collects all the outputs of the research project. Therefore a research project's website may fulfill the conceptual function of both a container for the project's outputs by collecting the relevant (meta)data in one place and (in part) a web service that gives access to the underlying data(sets) and data processing functions to interact with the data(sets) such as search functionalities (to use one of the most common examples). Lastly, by virtue of its ability to give users access to the datasets, a data service may also be conceptualized as another type of research output. </p>
        <p>Here is a practical example that shows how all four central DCAT classes come together in the KNOT-DM: a research project takes place over the course of 2 years with the goal to create a dataset and make it available to users for interaction via a web interface and via download. At the end of the project a website is published (represented by the Catalog class) which enables users to interact with the dataset’s contents via search functionalities (represented by the Data Service class), while the dataset itself (represented by the Dataset class) is also made available for direct download via a public repository in order to encourage further use (represented by the Distribution class). The outputs of the project within the Public Data Segment include the Catalog (website), Dataset, and Data Service (user-facing data processing and interaction system). All of these are connected to the activity of the research project, which is modeled using PROV-O (see next section).</p>
        <p>See the<a href="data_model_modules.html"> Modules section</a> and the <a href="website/ontology/index-en.html" target="_blank">Ontology</a> for details of how all the different properties and classes within the Public Data segment can be used to describe academic research projects. </p>

          <p>Figure 6 gives a complete overview of the academic provenance segment of the KNOT-DM, which is centered around two PROV-O classes: Activity and Entity. </p>
          <figure class="figure">
            <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded mx-auto" src="assets/imgs/provo_mapping_full.jpg">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">FIG 6. The PROV-O classes and properties used by KNOT-DM to describe academic provenance.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>A PROV-O Activity is defined as “something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.” [<a href="#bib-2">2</a>] Within KNOT-DM this is conceptualized as the representation of academic research projects as activities that use and generate entities. Therefore within KNOT-DM an academic research project is classified as both an instance of DCAT Catalog, to represent its role as a container for outputs, and as an instance of PROV-O Activity, to represent its activity aspects, with the prov:wasGeneratedBy property connecting them and making explicit that the activity generated all the outputs, including the container.</p>
          <p>A PROV-O Entity is defined as “a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary.” [<a href="#bib-2">2</a>] Within KNOT-DM this is conceptualized as the representation of academic research outputs, as well as inputs. As mentioned in the previous section this means that academic research outputs are classified as individuals belonging to both DCAT Dataset and PROV-O Entity classes in order to satisfy the connection between the Public Data and Academic Provenance Segments. Inputs for their part can also be modeled with this class, in order to reflect the entities that go into a research project from research questions to objects used or people and places studied. </p>
          <p>The relationship between the Activity and Entity classes can be detailed in a variety of ways using PROV-O properties used, wasInfluencedBy and generated as well as some qualified classes and properties (Derivation, Influence) which should be used to “provide elaborated information about binary relations” [<a href="#bib-2">2</a>] that cannot be covered by the other classes and properties. These qualified classes and properties are intended to be used if there is meaningful information about the research project that can be modeled such as for example to give further details on an entity that influenced the research project activity or about an entity that the research project output was derived from. Influence and Derivation were chosen as the two most relevant qualifications that PROV-O makes available within the context of the KNOT project. </p>
          <p>Lastly the range of the prov:wasInformedBy property, which is used to connect two activities within PROV-O, was extended to also include the CRMdig D7 Digital Machine Event class in order to establish a clear connection between the Academic Provenance and Cultural Heritage Information segments of the KNOT-DM, similar to the connection created by the prov:wasGeneratedBy property. More details on this connection are given in the Cultural Heritage Information section.</p>
          <p>Based on the practical example given in the DCAT section of this overview, our example research project is represented as an Activity in PROV-O which generated the DCAT Dataset, which is also represented as a PROV-O Entity, as well as the Data Service and Catalog. The project’s central research question was the exploration of the writings of a famous Italian politician. This politician and their writings can each also be represented as an Entity that influenced the project and, if the information is available, their influence can be detailed via the qualified Influence class and properties. The dataset that this specific activity created also made use of an existing dataset based on the writings of this historical figure. This existing dataset can be represented as a Derivation using the qualified classes or as another Entity with the prov:wasDerivedFrom property connecting it to the dataset the project created and the prov:used property connecting it to the activity. </p>
          <p>See the<a href="data_model_modules.html"> Modules section</a> and the <a href="website/ontology/index-en.html" target="_blank">Ontology</a> for details of how all the different properties and classes within the Academic Provenance segment can be used to describe academic research projects. </p>

          <p>Figure 7 gives a complete overview of the Cultural Heritage Information Segment of the KNOT-DM, which is centered on key classes from the CIDOC CRM extensions CRMdig — D7 Digital Machine Event and D1 Digital Object —and LRMoo (FKA FRBRoo) — F5 Item and F3 Manifestation.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">FIG 7. The CIDOC CRM classes and properties used by KNOT-DM to describe cultural heritage information.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>A CRMdig D7 Digital Machine Event is defined as comprising “events that happen on physical digital devices following a human activity that intentionally caused its immediate or delayed initiation and results in the creation of a new instance of D1 Digital Object on behalf of the human actor,” [<a href="#bib-4">4</a>] while a D1 Digital Object is defined as comprising “identifiable immaterial items that can be represented as sets of bit sequences, such as data sets, e-texts, images, audio or video items, software, etc., and are documented as single units.” [<a href="#bib-4">4</a>] Within KNOT-DM instances of D7 and its subclasses (which cover more specific types of activities that can take place on a digital device) are conceptualized as representing specific activities within the larger research project activity (a prov:Activity) and are connected to it by the prov:wasInformedBy property as described in the previous section. Instances of D1 and its subclasses (which cover more specific types of digital objects) meanwhile are yet another conceptualization of research project ouputs and inputs but specifically limited to the digital realm (in the case of outputs) and within the context of cultural heritage, a dimension that is not explicit in either DCAT or PROV-O. </p>
          <p>KNOT-DM makes use of two D7 subclasses: D2 Digitization Process, which represents the specific activity of transforming a physical object into a digital one, and D10 Software Execution, which can be used to represent more generic computational or software tasks run on a digital device, such as for example the transformation of text strings into XML. The data model also makes use of two D1 subclasses: D9 Data Object, which represents specific instances of D1 that contain quantitative properties (such as for example a linguistic corpus) and were created by D7, and D14 Software, which represent both the software programs or computer codes that an instance of D7 can use as well as a type of digital object that can be created by the research project activity. </p>
          <p>An F5 Item is defined as comprising “physical objects (printed books, scores, CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMS, etc.) that were produced by (P186i) an industrial process involving a given instance of F3 Manifestation,” while an F3 Manifestation is defined as comprising “products rendering one or more Expressions. A Manifestation is defined by both the overall content and the form of its presentation.” [<a href="#bib-5">5</a>] Within KNOT-DM these two classes are used specifically in conjunction with the D2 Digitization Process class. As such F5 represents the physical item that was used for digitization while F3 represents the manifestation that was used to produce the item. The latter can also be related to an entity via the CIDOC CRM P129 is about property in order to attach the subject of the item to the process (for example an author or a historical period). </p>
          <p>Based on the practical example given in the previous sections of this overview: the PROV-O Activity, which represents our example research project, was informed by a series of tasks that can be represented as D7, D2, or D10, such as for example the digitization of writings by the Italian politician which created instances of D9 and the use of instances of D14 to transform the digitized text (D9) into a final instance of D1 which represents the dataset created by the research project (and which is also classified as a DCAT Dataset and PROV-O Entity). Lastly the Italian politician can also be represented as a E1 Entity if necessary, which would allow for further detailing of the cultural heritage information around this person. </p>
          <p>See the<a href="data_model_modules.html"> Modules section</a> and the <a href="website/ontology/index-en.html" target="_blank">Ontology</a> for details of how all the different properties and classes within the Cultural Heritage Information Segment can be used to describe academic research projects. </p>

          <p>The three standards used within KNOT-DM each include classes which refer to similar concepts but are respectively defined with enough difference that they are not considered as being the same. </p>
          <p>While this issue could be solved by using the OWL equivalentClass axiom or the RDFS property subClassOf (pointing to a new specifically created class) the goal of KNOT-DM is to reuse existing standards as much as possible rather than create new classes or properties. As such it was decided during the design that individuals described with KNOT-DM should be assigned each class as appropriate to avoid issues.</p>
          <p>The conceptually similar classes cover the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>People and/or organizations involved in academic research projects, which can be assigned prov:Agent, foaf:Agent, and crm:E39_Actor classes.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>prov:Agent with the implication that the agent bears some form of responsibility towards a prov:Activity or prov:Entity.</li>
              <li>foaf:Agent with the implication that the agent is responsible for an action that is further defined by properties such as dct:creator or dct:publisher. </li>
              <li>crm:E39_Actor with a similar implication of responsibility as prov:Agent but in relation to specific activities within the overall academic research project activity (prov:Activity).</li>
              <li>Example: A researcher within our example project is responsible for the technological infrastructure that makes the final dataset available but is not involved or responsible for anything to do with the specific activities that created the dataset, such as the digitization of texts. This researcher should be given the prov:Agent and foaf:Agent classes. Conversely a researcher involved in creating the dataset but not in the development of the website or data service should be given the crm:E39_Actor and prov:Agent classes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Locations where research activity took place or which are represented in the results of academic research can be assigned prov:Location, dct:Location and crm:E53_Place classes. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>prov:Location with the implication that it can be a geographical or non-geographic place where activity took place.</li>
              <li>dct:Location with the implication that it is a spatial region or named place mentioned or covered by the data. </li>
              <li>crm:E53_Place with a similar implication as dct:Location but relating to activities. </li>
              <li>Example: the dataset created by our example project includes writings about Italy, while the project itself took place in Rome. Therefore dct:Location should be used to indicate Italy and attach it to the Dataset class while prov:Location and crm:E53_Place should be used to indicate Rome and attach it to the activities that led to the creation of the dataset. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Entities representing objects that are used and generated by academic research projects can be assigned prov:Entity, dcat:Dataset, and crmdig:D1_Digital_Object (incl. subclasses and related classes). </li>
            <ul>
              <li>prov:Entity with the implication that it can represent things with fixed aspects that are real or imaginary and used or generated in the activity of a research project. </li>
              <li>dcat:Dataset with the implication that it can only represent a collection of data created and published as a result of a research project activity.</li>
              <li>crmdig:D1_Digital_Object (and its subclasses D9_Data_Object and D14_Software), crm:E18_Physical_Thing (and its subclass F5 Item), and crm:E1_Entity with the implication that D1 and its subclasses are used to represent only digital objects created and/or used by specific tasks within the research activity (and which may ultimately form part of or also be a dcat:Dataset) while E18 is used to represent physical objects that undergo a process of digitization and E1 is used to represent the entity that the physical object is about. </li>
              <li>Classes in each of those segments are potentially connectable to each other via the dct:relation property. This is an optional property.</li>
              <li>Example: the dataset created by our example project is an instance of prov:Entity, dcat:Dataset and crmdig:D1_Digital_Object while the physical representations of the writings used in the digitization process are instances of E18 and/or F5 and the results of this process are instances of D9. The politician can be represented as both prov:Entity and crm:E1_Entity. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Activities representing the overall academic research project as well as specific things that happen within it can be assigned prov:Activity and crmdig:D7_Digital_Machine_Event (and its subclasses).</li>
            <ul>
              <li>prov:Activity is used to represent the overall research project activity.</li>
              <li>crmdig:D7_Digital_Machine_Event (and its subclasses D2_Digitization_Process and D10_Software_Execution) is used to represent specific sub-activities or tasks within the wider prov:Activity.</li>
              <li>These classes are connected via the prov:wasInformedBy property.</li>
              <li>Example: our example project is an instance of prov:Activity while the digitization of the politician’s writings and creation of the dataset based on this digitization are instances of D2 and D10 (or D7 if there are not enough specific details).</li>
