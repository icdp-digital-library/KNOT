      <p class="fs-5 col-md-8">KNOT-DM makes use of a specific set of authority records and controlled vocabularies for descriptions of key concepts and technical details as well as to facilitate search and navigation within the web application. </p>
      
      <p>KNOT-DM makes use of external authority records and controlled vocabularies drawn from the requirements of DCAT as well as those of the project as a whole. In addition, two controlled vocabularies have been created specifically for the project (see below). Concepts from these vocabularies and authorities can be attached to instances of classes representing activities and outputs within the Public Data and Cultural Heritage Information Segments of KNOT-DM using <code class="object-prop">dcat:theme</code>, <code class="object-prop">dct:type</code>, and <code class="object-prop">crm:P2_has_type</code>.</p>  

      <p>The following list details all the external authority records and controlled vocabularies used by KNOT-DM (see <a href="data_model_modules.html">the Modules section</a> for details on their application):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://schema.gov.it/lodview/controlled-vocabulary/licences" target="_blank">Licenze controlled vocabulary from AgID</a> is used to specify the licenses attached to data catalogs, datasets, distributions and data services.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://github.com/italia/daf-ontologie-vocabolari-controllati/tree/master/VocabolariControllati/classifications-for-culture/subject-disciplines" target="_blank">Ambiti Disciplinari controlled vocabulary from the OntoPia network</a> is used to specify the academic discipline the research project falls under.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geonames.org/" target="_blank">Geonames</a> is used to specify geographical locations.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/" target="_blank">Wikidata</a> is used to specify geographical locations, temporal periods, and people (lowest level of priority if another vocabulary or authority record in the list can specify the necessary information).</li>
        <li><a href="https://viaf.org/" target="_blank">VIAF</a> is used to specify people (takes precedence over Wikidata).</li>
        <li><a href="https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/" target="_blank">TaDiRAH</a>, the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities, is used to specify the types of research activities (focused on the first two levels of the taxonomy).</li>
        <li>The Data Theme, File Type, Access Right, Language, and Frequency <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/authority-tables" target="_blank">authority tables from the EU</a> are used to specify various technical aspects of research project outputs.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://purl.org/adms/status/1.0" target="_blank">ADMS Status vocabulary</a> is used to specify the state of a dataset’s distribution.</li>

      <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">The KNOT Controlled Vocabularies</h2>
      <p>The KNOT Controlled Vocabularies were developed to answer specific needs of the data model which were not appropriately covered by existing vocabularies, namely the need to classify the types of research project outputs KNOT documents and the need to have an authority control for technologies used in these outputs. This resulted in the creation of the KNOT Taxonomy and KNOT Technology Thesaurus, two SKOS-based controlled vocabularies that are part of the KNOT-DM.</p>
      <p>Both vocabularies were developed in an iterative process to refine their hierarchical structures and scope. Due to the central theme of the KNOT project, the <a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/intro_controlled_vocab/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies: Terminology for Art, Architecture, and Other Cultural Works</em></a> published by the Getty Research Institute was used as a key reference to help define which types of vocabularies to use while <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/" target="_blank">the SKOS standard from the W3C</a> was chosen to represent these vocabularies in RDF as it "provides a standard, low-cost migration path for porting existing knowledge organization systems to the Semantic Web" [<a href="#bib-1" id="back-1">1</a>]. Existing vocabularies specific to the field of Digital Humanities were also used as reference including TaDiRAH, <a href="https://vocabs.dariah.eu/parthenos_vocabularies/en/" target="_blank">PARTHENOS Vocabularies</a> and the <a href="https://vocabs.dariah.eu/dha_taxonomy/en/" target="_blank">DHA Taxonomy</a>, with the latter two originally considered as solutions to the needs of the KNOT project but found to not be precise or extensive enough. </p>
      <p>Taxonomy was chosen as a type of controlled vocabulary to answer the needs for an “orderly classification” of the KNOT project’s domain with a simple hierarchical structure through which to arrange the different types of research project outputs and detail their relationships [<a href="#bib-2" id="back-2">2</a>]. The thesaurus meanwhile was chosen to document the technologies used in academic research projects as it is a more complex type of controlled vocabulary that reflects a “semantic network of unique concepts” with a multiplicity of relationships and the necessary controls “recommended for use as authorities in databases relating to art and cultural heritage.” [<a href="#bib-2">2</a>]</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">FIG 2. Overview of the SKOS structure used for the controlled vocabularies.</figcaption>
          </figure>
      <p>Figure 2 details the SKOS structures used for both vocabularies. The taxonomy only employs <code class="grafoo-class">skos:ConceptScheme</code> and <code class="grafoo-class">skos:Concept</code>, in keeping with its simpler hierarchical structure, while the Thesaurus also makes use of <code class="grafoo-class">skos:Collection</code> to enable a deeper structure. <code class="object-prop">skos:related</code> is used to create non hierarchical connections between concepts within the same vocabulary while <code class="data-prop">skos:closeMatch</code> and <code class="data-prop">skos:relatedMatch</code> are used to connect the concepts to others in external vocabularies, primarily the <a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/" target="_blank">Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus</a>, the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html" target="_blank">Library of Congress Subject Headings</a>, the DHA Taxonomy, and the PARTHENOS Vocabularies.</p>
      <p>Both the KNOT Technology Thesaurus and Taxonomy are intended to be “living, growing tools” [<a href="#bib-2">2</a>] that will be updated throughout the duration of the KNOT project. During their development a list of editorial guidelines was created (see below), following suggestions laid out in Chapter 7 of the <em>Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies</em>. These rules are the first point of reference for any update to either vocabularies. </p>

          <h3>The KNOT Taxonomy</h3>
          <p>The list of concepts included in the KNOT Taxonomy reflects the most common types of research projects outputs encountered during the design phase of the KNOT-DM, based on a census of academic research projects from Italian universities (primarily focused within the humanities) which was also used to design the data model. </p>
          <p>This taxonomy is not intended as a complete or accurate picture of the landscape of academic research project outputs at Italian universities but rather as a starting point from which to begin addressing this complex topic with a view to incorporate the learnings into the guidelines that the KNOT project will produce. </p>
          <p>The concepts for the taxonomy were chosen and defined based on both existing literature and institutional definitions as well as the point of view of the research projects themselves, in order to account for both practical usage as well as ideal usage. As such a concept like Database reflects both its technical definition as well as its use by many research projects to describe a collection of resources and their metadata while a concept like Digital Archive is in practice almost always used to reflect a collection of items from different entities unified thematically which stands in contrast to the traditional definition of a collection of records originating from one person or organization and created in the course of their activity. </p>
          <p>As the KNOT project progresses the intention is to further refine the Taxonomy to include relevant concepts as well as find ways to reconcile practical and ideal uses. </p>
          <p>Figure 3 details the KNOT Taxonomy structure and concepts.</p>

          <h3>The KNOT Technological Thesaurus</h3>
          <p>Concepts for the KNOT Technology Thesaurus were drawn from the technologies found in the aforementioned census, with particular attention to concepts related to the technology stack of many web applications. This was due to existing thesauri often lacking in concepts relating to this particular point of interest. Concepts were then further expanded to also include research tasks, services, and tools and to therefore have the thesaurus be a more encompassing reference point for various relevant technological aspects of the KNOT project. </p>
          <p>From this the decision was taken to use <code class="grafoo-class">skos:Collection</code> to help create a deeper hierarchy as well as groupings for concepts that share something in common with the decision to begin with five collections: Computer & Information Sciences (representing research tasks and techniques), Data Storage, Formal Languages (representing programming and other technological languages), Information Technology Architecture (representing the IT stack), and Services & Tools (representing things that research projects both create or make available). As with the Taxonomy, these collections are not intended to be perfect or exact but rather reflect the needs of the project in its first year and act as a starting point from which to think about the specific issues of detailing the technologies that go into the digital cultural heritage created by academic research projects, which relates directly to the wider issue of obsolescence faced by many older projects.</p>
          <p>As of publication date for the first version, the Technology Thesaurus includes all the meaningful concepts that have been found in the census. Unlike the taxonomy, definitions for concepts in the thesaurus were kept as simple and factual as possible and wherever possible taken from trusted sources such as the Springer Handbook series or existing vocabularies such as the Getty AAT and LoC Subject Headings. </p>
          <p>Figure 4 details the KNOT Technological Thesaurus structure and concepts.</p>

          <h3>KNOT Controlled Vocabularies Editorial Guidelines </h3>
          <p>The editorial guidelines are intended as the first point of reference when updating the KNOT vocabularies. Updates to the vocabularies can be suggested by anyone but only implemented by a member of the KNOT project team.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Required fields for a new concept are: <code class="data-prop">skos:prefLabel</code> and <code class="data-prop">skos:altLabel</code>, <code class="data-prop">skos:definition</code>, <code class="data-prop">dcterms:source</code>, and <code class="data-prop">skos:closeMatch</code> or <code class="data-prop">skos:relatedMatch</code>. Structural elements, such as <code class="object-prop">skos:narrower</code>, <code class="object-prop">skos:broader</code>, and <code class="object-prop">skos:related</code> should be included based on where the concept will be placed in the hierarchy. </li>
            <li>The placement of a new concept should first be considered within the existing hierarchy, using <code class="object-prop">skos:narrower</code> or <code class="object-prop">skos:topConceptOf</code>. Only if no existing <code class="grafoo-class">skos:Collection</code> is sufficient to accommodate this new concept should an update to the existing hierarchy be considered, starting with the creation of a new collection.</li>
            <li><code class="data-prop">skos:prefLabel</code> should always favor the most common term in use for the concept that is not an abbreviation. <code class="data-prop">skos:altLabel</code> should always include abbreviations as well as other terms that may be more common within the fields the term is used in (jargon).</li>
            <li>Do not repeat shared elements of concepts in their definition but rather include them in the <code class="grafoo-class">skos:ConceptScheme</code> definition. This applies primarily to elements that concepts in the Taxonomy all have in common such as the use of digital-born and/or digitized objects or the fact that the research project’s question is a common theme for the selection of data. </li>
            <li>For something to qualify as a service it should be reusable and accessible. </li>
            <li><code class="data-prop">skos:definition</code> can differ from accepted definitions of the concept to reflect the point of view of the project but should do so based on evidence. Definitions should also where possible make clear what affordances the concept offers users. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Types of affordances include knowledge production and/or extraction, searching/findability, collaboration/participation, interactivity, analysis, multimodality, intertextuality.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the thesaurus concepts are described as simply as possible referencing the type of technology (e.g. software), relevant adjectives (e.g. open source), relevant used technology (e.g programming languages) and well-known use cases (e.g. a LAMP stack). <code class="object-prop">skos:related</code> can be used to create relevant internal links such as between a piece of software and the programming language used to create it. </li>
            <li>In the taxonomy <code class="object-prop">skos:related</code> is used to create internal links between concepts that could also be understood as <code class="object-prop">skos:narrower</code> in the real world. This is because it is preferred for concepts in the taxonomy to be <code class="object-prop">skos:topConceptOf</code> unless it is absolutely clear that it is a more specific version of an existing concept. For example, a Semantic Digital Edition is a narrower type of Digital Edition but a Knowledge Base is related to a Database, rather than being in a hierarchical relationship with it. </li>
            <li><code class="data-prop">skos:closeMatch</code> is used when an external vocabulary includes a near-identical concept (based on both the title of the concept and its definition, for example an existing concept for Javascript), while <code class="data-prop">skos:relatedMatch</code> is used for related concepts (for example the concept of Semantic Web is related to the concept of Linked Data). </li>
            <li>Terms are singular.</li>
            <li>English and Italian are the primary languages for both vocabularies. </li>
