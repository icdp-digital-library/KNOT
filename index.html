      <h1 class="text-body-emphasis">Supporting a New Digital Ecosystem of Culture...</h1>
      <p class="fs-5 col-md-8" id="copy">KNOT is a three-year pilot project from the University of Bologna and the Central Institute for the Digitization of Cultural Heritage (ICDP) - Digital Library of the Italian Ministry of Culture to showcase the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities.</p>
      
      <p>The project is part of an agreement between the University of Bologna and the Ministry to establish a research infrastructure to support the digital ecosystem of culture that is a central part of <a href="https://digitallibrary.cultura.gov.it/chi-siamo/" target="_blank">the ICDP’s mission</a>. To this end the University of Bologna is carrying out parallel and connected research initiatives in three departments (Department of Cultural Heritage - DBC, Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies - FICLIT, and Department of Computer Science and Engineering - DISI) with the goal of investigating ways to integrate the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities within the national infrastructure. </p>  
      <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">... By Rethinking Academic Research as Cultural Heritage</h2>
      <p>While a common understanding of the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities is focused on the transformation of analog holdings, these institutions are in fact already in possession of a large, multifaceted, and interesting example of digital cultural heritage: academic research projects. For years now, academic research has operated in a primarily digital space, with digital tools playing an increasingly important role in both the activity of research and the production of results as digital-born and/or digitized objects.  </p> 
      
      <p>The KNOT project takes this as its starting point to investigate a central question: how can academic research projects and their outputs be described and valorized as examples of digital cultural heritage? From this conceptual base, KNOT will, over the course of three years, leverage the Digital Library’s infrastructure alongside practices from the field of Digital Humanities to create a web application and guidelines for the collection, management, enrichment, and reuse of academic research. In doing so, the project aims to confront two central issues facing this central theme: the obsolescence of formats, media, applications and services that these projects use and generate; and a form of invisibility, driven by the lack of a shared, common framework for the display and preservation of projects, that has lead the existing documentation of research projects to be scattered across repositories (both institutional and public) and dedicated websites, further fragmenting its impact and reducing its potential valorization and recognition. </p>
      <p>Without going into detail with respect to these important issues, the KNOT project intends to not only work with existing data produced by academic research but also on tools and software developed for the benefit of cultural heritage, to make data and systems for accessing that data, or tools for enhancing it, dialogue in a shared environment. In this context, an academic research project understood as part of the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities will thus take many forms: a digital edition of a text or textual tradition; a linguistic, semantic or thematic corpus; a collection of digital objects (data and metadata) stemming from a specific line of research; a visualization tool; a user recommendation service; a system for analyzing text or semantically annotate images, video, or audio.</p>
      <p>KNOT is undertaken within the <a href="https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Advanced Research Center (/DH.ARC)</a>, part of the FICLIT department, with support from DISI, and in collaboration with the DBC, which is undertaking a two-year census of the digital and digitized cultural heritage of Italian universities.</p>
