In many cases these web services may well be part of the same website that is also conceptualized as an individual of the dcat:Catalog class, therefore a research project's website may fulfill the conceptual function of both a container for the project's outputs by collecting the relevant (meta)data in one place and a web service that gives access to the underlying data(sets) and data processing functions to interact with the data(sets) such as search functionalities (to use one of the most common examples). The PCDAI Data Model also refers to the usage guide note about distinctions between data service and distribution included in the DCAT AP 2.1.1 release that makes the following points: \"a data service is an entity in its own right\" that \"provides access to datasets or data processing functions\"; a distribution is \"not required to be the result of the data service operations\"; \"anything that has not the intend to provide a downloadable representation of a dataset is a data service, [they] offer smarter, more interactive ways to the data\".
