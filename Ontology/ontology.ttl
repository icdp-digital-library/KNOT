The resulting descriptive metadata is used in the PCDAI pilot project to catalogue academic research and integrate it into the national Digital Library initiative led by the Istituto Centrale per la Digitalizzazione del Patrimonio Culturale within the Ministero della Cultura. Both the ontology and the data model are freely available for universities, and other interested parties, to use to model their own data for independent use or to allow its inclusion within the pilot project."@en ;

The Data Model is divided into three segments, each attached to an existing standard within the ontology: public data (DCAT, including EU and IT Application Profiles); academic provenance (PROV-O), and cultural heritage information (CIDOC CRM and extensions). Together these segments allow to describe various aspects of academic research projects and their outputs within the context of the PCDAI pilot including: - Research project activity: who created what, how, where, and when. - This can be modeled as provenance using PROV-O elements centered on the prov:Activity class and/or as a form of cultural heritage activity using CIDOC CRM elements centered on the D7 Digital Machine Event class (from the CRMdig extension) - Further specificity as to what kinds of sub-activities took place within the research project can be expressed using subclasses of D7, such as for example digitization processes (D2 Digitization Process) or the use of software on digital objects (D10 Software Execution). - Research project outputs, the digital objects created by research project activities, can be represented regardless of their form as public datasets (DCAT), digital objects (CRMdig), or entities used in activities (PROV-O). - The ontology is intended to be flexible enough to enable the description of various possible outputs such as software, websites, documentation, web services, and data collections. - In addition to being conceptualized as activity, research projects are also conceptualized as a type of output within the DCAT segment of the model in order to act as a container for other research outputs. This conceptualization is intended to represent research projects websites, where outputs and documentation are often collected together in one place. - The agents responsible for creating and publishing research projects and outputs, from the individual to the organization via organizational units (such as departments or laboratories) and their locations. - Relationships between different research projects and their outputs, within an existing organization or across different organizations. - This includes concepts such as influence and inspiration as well as the reuse of outputs to create new projects and/or outputs. - The spatial and temporal information recorded in research project outputs, such as for example the places mentioned in a text or the time period covered by the data. - Themes such as the type of research activity, the type of outputs, the technologies used, the academic disciplines involved, and the primary and secondary subjects of research.

Usage Note: The PCDAI Data Model brings together three different 'segments' - public data, cultural heritage, provenance - each based around a standard that includes classes which refer to similar concepts but which are respectively defined with enough difference that individuals should be assigned each class (as appropriate) to avoid issues. In the case of activity, the data model conceptualizes research projects as examples of activities using E7_Activity (in the cultural heritage context) and prov:Activity (in the provenance context), which conceptualizes activity as related to time as well as acting upon entities. The DCAT model includes a clear connection between the dataset class and the activity class via the prov:wasGeneratedBy property which is a starting point for the PCDAI Data Model's dual conceptualization of research projects as both activity and datasets that contain other datasets (dcat:Catalog). In this sense, a research project is an activity that generates a container that holds all of the output of the activity. Please see the Data Model documentation for full details of how PCDAI makes use of classes and properties that relate to similar concepts but refer to specific conceptual definitions."@en ;

In the case of activity, the data model conceptualizes research projects as examples of activities using E7_Activity (in the cultural heritage context) and prov:Activity (in the provenance context), which conceptualizes activity as related to time as well as acting upon entities. The DCAT model includes a clear connection between the dataset class and the activity class via the prov:wasGeneratedBy property which is a starting point for the PCDAI Data Model's dual conceptualization of research projects as both activity and datasets that contain other datasets (dcat:Catalog).
