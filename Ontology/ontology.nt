<http://example.org/pcdai> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "The PCDAI Data Model Ontology brings together existing and complementary ontological entities from three primary standards for the purpose of describing academic research projects and their outputs as examples of the digital cultural heritage of Italian universities. The resulting descriptive metadata is used in the PCDAI pilot project to catalogue academic research and integrate it into the national Digital Library initiative led by the Istituto Centrale per la Digitalizzazione del Patrimonio Culturale within the Ministero della Cultura. Both the ontology and the data model are freely available for universities, and other interested parties, to use to model their own data for independent use or to allow its inclusion within the pilot project."@en .

<http://example.org/pcdai> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The PCDAI Data Model Ontology connects complementary ontological entities from existing standards to provide descriptive metadata for use within the PCDAI pilot project (link TBC). The Data Model is divided into three segments, each attached to an existing standard within the ontology: public data (DCAT, including EU and IT Application Profiles); academic provenance (PROV-O), and cultural heritage information (CIDOC CRM and extensions). Together these segments allow to describe various aspects of academic research projects and their outputs within the context of the PCDAI pilot including: - Research project activity: who created what, how, where, and when. - This can be modeled as provenance using PROV-O elements centered on the prov:Activity class and/or as a form of cultural heritage activity using CIDOC CRM elements centered on the D7 Digital Machine Event class (from the CRMdig extension) - Further specificity as to what kinds of sub-activities took place within the research project can be expressed using subclasses of D7, such as for example digitization processes (D2 Digitization Process) or the use of software on digital objects (D10 Software Execution). - Research project outputs, the digital objects created by research project activities, can be represented regardless of their form as public datasets (DCAT), digital objects (CRMdig), or entities used in activities (PROV-O). - The ontology is intended to be flexible enough to enable the description of various possible outputs such as software, websites, documentation, web services, and data collections. - In addition to being conceptualized as activity, research projects are also conceptualized as a type of output within the DCAT segment of the model in order to act as a container for other research outputs. This conceptualization is intended to represent research projects websites, where outputs and documentation are often collected together in one place. - The agents responsible for creating and publishing research projects and outputs, from the individual to the organization via organizational units (such as departments or laboratories) and their locations. - Relationships between different research projects and their outputs, within an existing organization or across different organizations. - This includes concepts such as influence and inspiration as well as the reuse of outputs to create new projects and/or outputs. - The spatial and temporal information recorded in research project outputs, such as for example the places mentioned in a text or the time period covered by the data. - Themes such as the type of research activity, the type of outputs, the technologies used, the academic disciplines involved, and the primary and secondary subjects of research. These themes are described using a selection of specific controlled vocabularies and authorities. <https://laurentfintoni.com/pcdai/data_model_core.jpg>"@en .

The input of a D7 Digital Machine Event may be parameter settings and/or data to be processed. Some D7 Digital Machine Events may form part of a wider E65 Creation event. In this case, all machine output of the partial events is regarded as creation of the overall activity. Usage Note: The PCDAI Data Model brings together three different 'segments' - public data, cultural heritage, provenance - each based around a standard that includes classes which refer to similar concepts but which are respectively defined with enough difference that individuals should be assigned each class (as appropriate) to avoid issues. This class should be used to represent a research project as an example of activity within the cultural heritage segment of the data model. As such this class indicates the cultural heritage dimension of the research project activity, by focusing on how research projects make use of existing cultural heritage entities to produce new digital objects. By contrast, the research project activity under the PROV-O model does not have this cultural heritage association and is meant to represent its academic provenance."@en .
