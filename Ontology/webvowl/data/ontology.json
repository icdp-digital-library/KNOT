      "en" : "The PCDAI Data Model Ontology connects complementary ontological entities from existing standards to provide descriptive metadata for use within the PCDAI pilot project (link TBC). The Data Model is divided into three segments, each attached to an existing standard within the ontology: public data (DCAT, including EU and IT Application Profiles); academic provenance (PROV-O), and cultural heritage information (CIDOC CRM and extensions). Together these segments allow to describe various aspects of academic research projects and their outputs within the context of the PCDAI pilot including: - Research project activity: who created what, how, where, and when. - This can be modeled as provenance using PROV-O elements centered on the prov:Activity class and/or as a form of cultural heritage activity using CIDOC CRM elements centered on the D7 Digital Machine Event class (from the CRMdig extension) - Further specificity as to what kinds of sub-activities took place within the research project can be expressed using subclasses of D7, such as for example digitization processes (D2 Digitization Process) or the use of software on digital objects (D10 Software Execution). - Research project outputs, the digital objects created by research project activities, can be represented regardless of their form as public datasets (DCAT), digital objects (CRMdig), or entities used in activities (PROV-O). - The ontology is intended to be flexible enough to enable the description of various possible outputs such as software, websites, documentation, web services, and data collections. - In addition to being conceptualized as activity, research projects are also conceptualized as a type of output within the DCAT segment of the model in order to act as a container for other research outputs. This conceptualization is intended to represent research projects websites, where outputs and documentation are often collected together in one place. - The agents responsible for creating and publishing research projects and outputs, from the individual to the organization via organizational units (such as departments or laboratories) and their locations. - Relationships between different research projects and their outputs, within an existing organization or across different organizations. - This includes concepts such as influence and inspiration as well as the reuse of outputs to create new projects and/or outputs. - The spatial and temporal information recorded in research project outputs, such as for example the places mentioned in a text or the time period covered by the data. - Themes such as the type of research activity, the type of outputs, the technologies used, the academic disciplines involved, and the primary and secondary subjects of research. These themes are described using a selection of specific controlled vocabularies and authorities. <https://laurentfintoni.com/pcdai/data_model_core.jpg>"

      "en" : "An accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file (W3C DCAT documentation). Usage Note: This class is intended to represent the downloadable forms that a dataset can take. While both the W3C and DCAT AP definitions could be interpreted as covering non-downloable forms (one can access a dataset via a web interface and never actually have access to the underlying data itself on a local machine), within the context of the PCDAI Data Model the distribution class explicitly refers only to downloadable forms. As with the data service class, we make close reference to the DCAT AP 2.1.1 usage guide note on distinctions between distribution and data service, which makes it clear that while datasets and data services are entities in their own right a distribution cannot exist without its dataset. It further states: \"distributions are specific representations of a dataset, described with the intend to facilitate the delivery of the data as file to a reuser. The access URL (preferably download URL) will provide a simple way to obtain (download) the content of the dataset in the representation specified by the distribution. The obtained (downloaded) content is fully determined by the publisher of the distribution. Only after obtaining the data the (re)user can change the data according to its needs. \"."
